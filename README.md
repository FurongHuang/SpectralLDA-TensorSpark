# Spectral LDA on Spark

## Summary 
* This code implements a Spectral (third order tensor decomposition) learning method for learning LDA topic model on Spark.
* We also implemented a Spectral LDA model via sketching to accelerate tensor building and decomposition.
* Version: 1.0

## How do I get set up?
We use the `sbt` build system. By default we support Scala 2.11.8 and Spark 2.0.0 upward. In `build.sbt` we also support cross build to Scala 2.10.6.

For example, the first line below will compile and package the code using Scala 2.11.8 as it's the default setup. The second line uses Scala 2.10.6 as we explicitly called for it. If we precede any `sbt` command by the `+` sign as does the third line, both the Scala 2.10 and 2.11 based versions will be produced.

```bash
sbt package
sbt ++2.10.6 package
sbt "+ package"
```

### To build the project
1. install `sbt`
2. open your terminal:

    ```bash
    cd SpectralLDA-TensorSpark
    sbt "+ assembly"
    ```    
    
    This will pack the class files and all the dependencies into a single fat JAR file for both Scala 2.10 and 2.11. The path to the jar is: `<PROJECT-PATH>/target/scala-<ver>/SpectralLDA-Tensor-assembly-1.0.jar`
3. deploy the application using [spark-submit](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html).  

### Let's run some experiments

1. Synthetic Experiments:
    ```bash
    ./bin/spark-submit --class edu.uci.eecs.spectralLDA.SpectralLDA \
    --master local[2] --deploy-mode client \
    <PROJECT-PATH>/target/scala-<ver>/SpectralLDA-Tensor-assembly-1.0.jar \
    <PROJECT-PATH>/src/main/resources/Data/datasets/synthetic/samples_train_libsvm.txt \
    --libsvm 1 
    ```
    1. Data generation script in MATLAB is provided in the repository [here](https://bitbucket.org/furongh/spectral-lda/src/b5be6b9e2a45b824bbc60a0bb927eff6030f4256/Code/tensorfac/data/SyntheticDataGenerator.m?at=master&fileviewer=file-view-default). One can play around with hyperparameters such as Sample Size, Vocabulary Size, Hidden Dimension, and How mixed the topics are.  The synthetic data for training are then generated as `datasets/synthetic/samples_train_libsvm.txt` and `datasets/synthetic/samples_test_libsvm.txt` in the libsvm format and as `datasets/synthetic/samples_train_DOK.txt` and `datasets/synthetic/samples_test_DOK.txt` in the DOK format. 
    2. Our program reads libsvm format.

2. Real Experiments:
    ```bash
    ./bin/spark-submit --class edu.uci.eecs.spectralLDA.SpectralLDA \
    --master local[2] --deploy-mode client \
    <PROJECT-PATH>/target/scala-<ver>/SpectralLDA-Tensor-assembly-1.0.jar \
    <PROJECT-PATH>/src/main/resources/Data/datasets/enron_email/corpus.txt
    ```
    1. Our program takes raw text (NOTE: Each text file line should hold 1 document). 

### Set up Spark 2.0.0 to use system native BLAS/LAPACK

1. In order for Spark to use system native BLAS/LAPACK, first compile Spark 2.0.0 with the option `-Pnetlib-lgpl` to include all the artifacts of `netlib4java`, following the advice [here](http://apache-spark-user-list.1001560.n3.nabble.com/Mllib-native-netlib-java-OpenBLAS-td19662.html).

    ```bash
    mvn -Pyarn -Phadoop-2.7 -Pnetlib-lgpl -DskipTests clean package
    ```

    `netlib4java` includes the JNI routines to load up the system native BLAS/LAPACK libraries. 

2. Now we're going to make the system native BLAS/LAPACK libraries available to `netlib4java`. On Mac, `netlib4java` will automatically find `veclib`; on Linux, we could use ATLAS.

3. Lastly set up symbollic links for the `libblas.so.3` and `liblapack.so.3` that `netlib4java` looks for. 

    ```bash
    sudo alternatives --install /usr/lib64/libblas.so libblas.so /usr/lib64/atlas/libtatlas.so.3 1000
    sudo alternatives --install /usr/lib64/libblas.so.3 libblas.so.3 /usr/lib64/atlas/libtatlas.so.3 1000
    sudo alternatives --install /usr/lib64/liblapack.so liblapack.so /usr/lib64/atlas/libtatlas.so.3 1000
    sudo alternatives --install /usr/lib64/liblapack.so.3 liblapack.so.3 /usr/lib64/atlas/libtatlas.so.3 1000
    ```

Now if we run the above experiments again, any "WARN BLAS" or "WARN LAPACK" messages should have disappeared.
